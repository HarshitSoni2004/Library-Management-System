# Library Management System (Java CLI)

## Project Description
This is a command-line based Library Management System developed in Java. It allows managing library operations such as adding/removing books, registering users (students and teachers), issuing and returning books, and listing available books. The system demonstrates object-oriented design with classes for Admin, User, Book, and Library, and supports basic user authentication and book availability tracking.

## Features
- Add and remove books (admin only)
- Register users (students and teachers) with borrowing limits
- Issue and return books with availability checks
- List all books with details
- Simple CLI menu-driven interface for interaction

## How to Run
1. Compile all `LMS.java` files:
2. Run the main class:
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform operations.

## Future Improvements
- Add persistent storage (database or file)
- Implement user login with password authentication
- Enhance CLI with search and sorting features
- Add GUI for better usability
